# Machine Learning Algorithm and Python Source code
For any Machine Learning Algorithm We need to Flow Data Preprocessing Part
#### Data Preprocessing
There are some steps need to flow Data Preprocessing:-
  * Importing the Libraries(Require)
  * Importing the Dataset (Require)
  * Fulfill Missing Data (Optional)
  * Categorical Data (Optional)
  * Splitting the Dataset into the Training set and Test set (Require)
  * Feature Scaling (Optional)

First we need to create basics template for Data Preprocessing. Template reduce our code work.

I try to cover Some Machine Learning Algorithm

1. [Regression](https://github.com/prince-m-kumar/MLALGO/tree/master/Regression)
2. Classification
3. Clustering
4. Deep Learning
5. Dimensionality Reduction
